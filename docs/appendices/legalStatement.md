# Legal Statement

## GDPR Compliance Statement
Classroom Explorers is designed with user privacy as a priority. We do not collect, process, or share personal information. Any data created during gameplay is stored locally on the user’s device and is never transmitted externally unless explicitly required by certain features (e.g., optional online leaderboards or cloud storage). Classroom Explorers fully adheres to GDPR requirements, ensuring that no personal data is handled without the user's clear consent.

## Software License Notice
Classroom Explorers is distributed under a proprietary, closed-source license. The source code is confidential and is not publicly available. Only authorized members of our development team and, where relevant, approved academic reviewers may access the codebase. End users are granted a limited license to use the software in accordance with the terms specified in the End-User License Agreement (EULA).

# Privacy Policy
At Classroom Explorers, we are dedicated to safeguarding your privacy. Here’s how we manage data within the app:

### What Data Do We Collect?
We do not collect any personal information. The game is fully functional without requiring users to submit personal details, and no identifiable data is stored or shared externally.

### Permissions:
The game may request permissions such as access to storage, camera, microphone, or internet depending on specific gameplay features. However, no data from these features is collected or transmitted unless expressly stated in the context of a feature (e.g., cloud saves, multiplayer).

### Security of Data:
Any non-personal data, such as game settings or local save files, is protected through reasonable security measures to prevent unauthorized access or changes.

### External Services:
Classroom Explorers does not integrate with third-party services that collect personal information. Should a feature require such integration (e.g., connecting to an online leaderboard), we will always request explicit consent beforehand.

### Children's Data:
We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. If we become aware of any unintentional collection, we will promptly delete the information.

### Policy Updates:
We may revise this Privacy Policy periodically. Changes will be communicated via in-app notifications and/or updates to our official website. Continued use of Classroom Explorers after updates indicates acceptance of the revised terms.
