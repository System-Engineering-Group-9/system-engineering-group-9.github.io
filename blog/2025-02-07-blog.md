# Week 15&16: board generation using json & image generation

---

### Over the past two weeks, we made significant progress in enhancing the teacher UI and improving the overall gameplay experience in our mixed reality board game.

---

### Key Achievements:

- **Board Generation via JSON:**
    - Implemented a system where teachers can design custom board layouts through the teacher UI.
    - The board configuration is transferred as a JSON file from the UI to the Unity game, ensuring seamless integration.
- **Image Generation for Themed Boards:**
    - Integrated **DreamShaper**, a lightweight AI model, to generate images based on the game's theme.
    - These images serve as dynamic background visuals for the game board, enhancing immersion.
- **Avatar Customization & Player Info:**
    - Developed an **avatar selection system** where users can customize their avatars with different colors and hats.
    - Created a **player information pop-up** that displays detailed player statistics and attributes.

**Next Steps:**

- **Multiplayer Functionality:**
    - Implement **Photon PUN 2** as the networking solution to support real-time multiplayer gameplay.
    - Synchronize offline players to ensure a smooth and consistent game experience.
