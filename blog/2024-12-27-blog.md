# Week 9&10 - Teacher UI Setup

---

### Over the past two weeks, we made substantial progress in developing key components of our mixed reality board game in Unity, focusing on enhancing both gameplay and the teacher interface.

---

### Key Achievements:

- **Teacher UI Interface:** Completed the basic structure of the teacher interface. After evaluating various options, we concluded that a web-based interface would be more accessible and user-friendly for teachers, making it easier to manage and monitor the game.
- **Scoring System:** Implemented a dynamic scoring system to track player progress and provide real-time feedback during gameplay.
- **Quiz Elements:** Developed quiz components directly within the game, introducing an educational layer to enhance player engagement.

### Next Steps:

- **AI-Generated Questions:** Explore methods for using AI to dynamically generate quiz questions, adding a personalized and adaptive learning experience.
- **Integration with Teacher Web Interface:** Focus on connecting the web-based teacher interface to the game to enable seamless communication and real-time updates between the teacher's dashboard and gameplay.

We are excited about these developments and look forward to advancing the project in the coming weeks.
