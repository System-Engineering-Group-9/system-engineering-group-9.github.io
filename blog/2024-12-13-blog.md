# Week 7&8 - Basic Game Functionality

---

### During week 7 and 8, our team made significant progress in designing and developing the foundation for our mixed reality board game in Unity. We successfully created the initial game board layout and implemented essential game components, including player and game managers to handle core game logistics such as turn management and player interactions.

### Key Progress Highlights Include:

- **Board Design:** A well-structured game board was designed to facilitate smooth and dynamic gameplay.
- **Player and Game Managers:** Core game logic was established, enabling efficient player tracking, turn rotation, and event handling.
- **Basic Game Mechanics:** Initial gameplay functionality was developed to support player interactions and game flow.
- **Basic Avatar Selection:** Allow user to select their own avatar and input their name.

### Moving Forward:

We plan to implement a dedicated teacher interface to monitor game progress and interactions. Additionally, we will introduce a quiz scene to enhance player engagement and add an educational element to the game.

We remain committed to refining and expanding the game to deliver an engaging and educational experience.
