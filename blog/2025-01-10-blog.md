### Over the past two weeks, we made significant strides in both functionality and user experience, while preparing for important project milestones.

### Key Achievements:

- **IBM Granite Integration:** Successfully connected IBM Granite to the teacher UI, enabling the dynamic generation of quiz questions.
- **Board Features Expansion:** Expanded the board to support more than two players and added new interactive blocks, including teleport, add score, and subtract score.
- **Improved Board Visuals:** Enhanced the visuals of the game board to clearly indicate the path players should take, creating a more intuitive and enjoyable experience.
- **UI Refinements:** Refined the user interface to make it more visually friendly and accessible, with a focus on being less aggressive for SEND students.
