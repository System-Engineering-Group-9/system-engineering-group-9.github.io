# Week 13&14: Student and Teacher API Implementation

---

### In these weeks, we made significant progress in enhancing the game's functionality and collaboration features.

### Key Achievements:

- **Server and API Development:** We successfully created a server to host the teacher UI and developed an API to allow seamless communication between the game and the teacher interface.
- **Cooperative Mode:** Began developing a cooperative mode, allowing students to collaborate with each other to achieve shared goals.
- **Boss Feature:** Introduced a boss into the game, providing an additional challenge for students to work together and defeat as a team.
