# Week 3&4 - HCI & Requirements

---

### During these weeks, we focused on understanding user needs and laying the groundwork for designing an inclusive game experience through the HCI assignment.

---

### HCI Assignment:

We began by:
- Reviewing assigned resources on human-computer interaction.
- Holding additional meetings with NAS teachers to identify impactful features for SEND students.

---

### Key Insights:

These discussions provided a deeper understanding of focus areas beyond initial requirements, helping us prioritize features that would best support the target audience.

---

### Preparation for HCI Presentation:

We leveraged our research and meetings to:
- Develop a comprehensive user requirements list.
- Create detailed personas representing typical users of the Mixed Reality board game.
